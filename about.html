        <h5 class="subtit2">Outdoor Enthusiast:</h5>
        <p class="description2">
          I have a deep love for the outdoors and enjoy activities like
          gardening, kayaking, and hiking. I tend to find myself adventuring
          throughout the world as well, from skydiving over the Grand Canyon to
          inner tubing through the caves of Belize and walking the rocky beaches
          of a castle in Scotland. Exploring nature and experiencing new
          adventures is my way of rejuvenating and finding inspiration.

        <h5 class="subtit2">Gaming Fanatic:</h5>
        <p class="description2">
          I'm also an avid gamer, and what I enjoy most is the customization
          aspect. I started playing on Xbox and am biased towards a controller.
          Some of my favorite games include Destiny 2, Stardew Valley, Skyrim,
          and Fallout 4. Whether I'm battling through epic quests or tending to
          a virtual farm, gaming allows me to immerse myself in diverse worlds
          and challenges.

          dynamic to everyday life. Together, we care for our adorable pets: two
          cats named Rootbeer and Bella, who bring joy and mischief, and
          Norbert, the laid-back bearded dragon who keeps us entertained with
          his quirky antics.
